 // Take two bool arrays vis1 and vis2 of size N (number of nodes of a graph) and keep false in all indexes.
 //Start at a random vertex v of the graph G, and run a DFS(G, v).
 //Make all visited vertices v as vis1[v] = true.
 //Now reverse the direction of all the edges.
 //Start DFS at the vertex which was chosen at step 2.
 //Make all visited vertices v as vis2[v] = true.
 //If any vertex v has vis1[v] = false and vis2[v] = false then the graph is not connected.
